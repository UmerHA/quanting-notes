# Quanting notes

Hey there, 

I'm learning about quantization, and I learn best when I explain stuff - so here are my notes which over time should morph into a "zero to hero" for quanting.

The goal is to understand **how** quanting is done (ie you can then implement it from scratch), **not** evaluating quanting methods. Doing that well would take more resources than I can allocate to this. 

You can help by opening an issue if
- you don't understand something
- something is wrong
- you think I should cover a certain topic

I invite you to ask many questions. I don't bite :)

Cheers from Germany,
